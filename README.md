# Tool for merging SPDX files  

This tool integrates multiple SPDX JSON formatted Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) into a parent SBOM, either by consolidating all the contents into a single file or by creating references to multiple files.  

The tool works with SPDX 2.2 and SPDX 2.3 versions.  

## Features  

Combine multiple SPDX JSON/Tag value files into a single parent Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in one of two ways:  

- **Deep Merge** - Combines the contents of all SBOM files into a single comprehensive parent file, incorporating all the information about the package dependencies and their relationships.  
- **Shallow Merge** - Generates a parent SBOM that references multiple SBOM files in the `externalDocumentRefs` section.  

## How to use  

### Manual Installation  

SPDX Tools (`spdx-tools`) needs to be installed as a prerequisite for this application to work. It is listed in the `requirements.txt` file.  
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:  

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

Execute the command with the required inputs:  

```shell
    python spdxmerge/SPDXMerge --docpath <folder path of the SBOMs to be merged>
                         --outpath <folder path where the merged file will be saved> (optional)
                         --name <product name>
                         --version <product version>
                         --mergetype <0 for deep merge/1 for shallow merge>
                         --author <organization or author name>
                         --email <org/author email>
                         --docnamespace <namespace for SPDX document>
                         --filetype <expected SBOM file format for JSON/T for Tag value>
```  

### ðŸ”¹ **New Update: Version Input**  
To establish a unique **"DESCRIBES"** relationship in the SPDX document, a **root package** must be created.  
For this, we now require both **name** and **version** as input parameters.
